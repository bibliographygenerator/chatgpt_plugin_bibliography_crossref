#### Simplifying Scientific Research with AI and Crossref

Ever wished your AI could talk science without making stuff up? Now it can! We're using the power of GPT-4 Plus and a tool called Crossref to make sure your AI speaks real science, not science fiction.

With our tool, GPT-4 Plus doesn't just guess or make up scientific references - it pulls them from Crossref, a massive database of real scientific articles and papers. So, when you ask about a scientific topic, you get accurate, reliable information, complete with real DOI numbers.

Plus, with Zotero, you can save and manage all the cool scientific discoveries you find.
